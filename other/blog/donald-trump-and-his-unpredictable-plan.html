			First of all I would like to say that I do not support Donald Trump and hence the following post will be biased. Now 58% of Americans do not support Trump but I am still surprised by the 42% who still do and so I decided to write here some reasons why Donald Trump is not the ideal President.
			<br><br>
			- His Imaturity on Twitter and in General
			<br><br>
			When you imagine a president in general you expect them to be serious, logical, be able to adapt and have perseverance. Being the president of the US means being the president of one third of the world. Yet Donald Trump's tweets so how imature and narcissistic he is. Excluding all tweets he posted before being the president and concentrating on his political tweets it looks like most of the time he is a hypocrite:
			<br><br>
			"Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. <em>Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views</em>." ~ <a href='https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/823174199036542980' target='_blank'>@realDonaldTrump, 22 Jan 2017</a>
			<br><br>
			And then...
			<br><br>
			"Donald Trump blasts NFL anthem protesters: 'Get that son of a bitch off the field'" ~ <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests' target='_blank'>The Guardian, 22 Sep 2017</a>
			<br><br>
			Another example:
			<br><br>
			"President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!" ~ <a href='https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/768119463421943808' target='_blank'>@realDonaldTrump, 23 Aug 2016</a>
			<br><br>
			But actually Donald Trump did the same thing:
			<br><br>
			"Lost weekend: How Trump’s time at his golf club hurt the response to Maria" ~ <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lost-weekend-how-trumps-time-at-his-golf-club-hurt-the-response-to-maria/2017/09/29/ce92ed0a-a522-11e7-8c37-e1d99ad6aa22_story.html?utm_term=.0775a751e1e3' target='_blank'>The Washington Post, 29 Sep 2017</a>
			<br><br>
			There are plenty examples of Donald Trump being a hypocrite. In fact there is a dedicated subreddit <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump' target='_blank'>r/TrumpCriticizesTrump</a> where people point out his hypocrisy.
			<br><br>
			- His Plan for the Future
			<br><br>
			Before the elections Donald Trump wanted to make America great by initiating the following actions:
			<br><br>
			1.) Balance imports and exports (raise tariffs by 50% on imports from China and 35% from Mexico)
			<br><br>
			2.) Reforming America’s Legal Immigration System (and building a wall in the American-Mexican border)
			<br><br>
			3.) Cut Government Spending (by decreasing spending in non-military departments) 
			<br><br>
			4.) Be the Greatest Job-Producing President in U.S. History
			<br><br>
			5.) Reduce the Debt by Growing the Economy 6 Percent
			<br><br>
			<em>Note: This list was taken from <a href='https://www.thebalance.com/donald-trump-economic-plan-3994106' target='_blank'>here</a>. It is not Donald Trump's official website but navigating through his site is extremely difficult and some links that I had from his site are now removed or probably changed to another location.</em>
			<br><br>
			Those are some good ways to improve America's economy however there are several contradictions:
			<br><br>
			- Cut Goverment Spending <b>but also</b> build a huge wall (aprox. $35 billion)
			<br>
			- <a href='https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/03/trumps-education-budget-revealed/519837/' target='_blank'>Cut spending in the Education Department</a> <b>and</b> expect more jobs
			<br><br>
			I want to end this by saying that I am a bit confused as to what I want Donald Trump to do. Do I want him to keep his promise on building a wall and placing huge tariffs <em>or</em> do I want Donald Trump to not do those two actions?

			Unfortunately both occasions have negative consequences. 
			<br><br>
			The former will increase the Government Spending since building a wall is expensive. Now increasing the tariffs is a good idea, but increasing them by 50% is an unwise exaggeration. A car that was made in China when exported to America costed $10 000 will now cost $15 000 (same example applies to smartphones that are also made in China).
			<br><br>
			The latter will mean that Donald Trump did not keep his promise. Economically this could be a benefit but not keeping a promise means that Donald Trump talked about an interesting plan for the future so the citizens will like it and vote for him and after winning the elections he changes his plans/aims. I hope this does not happen because after Donald Trump any President could exaggerate on how they will improve America and then after the elections they will not keep their promise and have a completely different agenda.
