			Since then, many companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Reddit and many more raised awareness of this issue by placing banners on their websites, explaining what is net neutrality and why net neutrality rules should not be modified. The show “Last Week Tonight with James Oliver” made two episodes regarding Pai’s proposal against net neutrality in which Oliver mentioned that everyone should go to the FCC website and file a complaint that net neutrality should remain. The website received over 2.6 million complaint (comments).
			I want to write an editorial stating clearly what net neutrality is and why Title II should not be modified as well as comment on the motive of FCC and why Ajit Pai does not want net neutrality.

			The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) received a DDoS attack immediately after John Oliver's episode in "Last Week Tonight" regarding net neutrality.

			<em style="font-size: 25px;font-weight: normal;">What is Net Neutrality,</em>
			<br><br>
			Net neutrality is a list of rules that allow every internet user to have access to all the internet content and <em>prevent</em> service providers like Comcast and Verizon from intentionally throttling the bandwidth of certain users or intentionally slowing down specific websites/sources.
			<br><br>
			Net neutrality laws existed for a while but in this investigation we will focus on Ajit Pai. In 2017, Ajit Pai (Chairman of the FCC under the Trump Administration) wanted to change the net neutrality rules so they can be “modernized” to “match the reality of the modern marketplace”. The members of the FCC decided to move forward with Pai’s proposal and subsequently this caused a lot of criticism because if the net neutrality rules would be deregulated, then service providers which are private firms would have control of the internet and who sees what content on it.
